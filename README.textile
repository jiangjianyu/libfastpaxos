The library is still in development, this version however is usable.
More details and proper code documentation coming soon, for the moment you can refer to the tests for usage examples.

NOTE To Linux users:
This library was tested on Mac OS X only, i never even tried to compile on Linux. I'll make sure everything works as soon as possible.
